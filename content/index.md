# Welcome!
I am Mohamed Fahmy, a software engineer with great interest in compilers, distributed systems and network programming.

Feel free to reach out to me for further discussion about some topic, or if you want to give me feedback.
This site has nothing to do with my any company nor professional purpose.
You'll find only personal-related projects and material.
Feel free to have a look at the articles I write on my blog.

However, If you are a recruiter, you might be interested in my Github profile, and/or contacting me via Linkedin.
